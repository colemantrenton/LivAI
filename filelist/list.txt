wavs/01.wav|One comes into a world of unimaginable cruelty, most of which remains silent, subtle, evades the ruthless abstraction of statistics.
wavs/02.wav|A daily death felt thousands of times by billions of people.
wavs/03.wav|One comes into this world, with a will to change it.
wavs/04.wav|Yet one’s spirit is shaken by the countless other kindred souls, who had similar intentions, that burnt bright with an admirable passion far beyond the young sparks that flicker in and out today.
wavs/05.wav|One’s spirit is shaken that despite their passion, these old flames were nevertheless extinguished.
wavs/06.wav|To try as they had tried.
wavs/07.wav|To fail as they had failed.
wavs/08.wav|There is a beauty, in those moments of historical significance, that fed the flames of those passionate creatives.
wavs/09.wav|That inimitable feeling of the world moving around your feet.
wavs/10.wav|Lenin frolicking in the snow, upon hearing his revolution, had outlasted the Paris Commune.
wavs/11.wav|But these moments, steeped with emotions only known by those who had lived them, become passionless historical facts.
wavs/12.wav|The passing of time fossilizes them, abstracting away their authentic, felt meaning and subsequently inspiring a flame no hotter than the snow that crunched under Lenin’s joyful feet.
wavs/13.wav|These events, when rendered historical objects of the past, inspire nothing that could affect one’s passion; their real felt values decompose like flesh on skeleton.
wavs/14.wav|All we are left with is the sanitized, objective, unfelt, uncaring bones of empirical procedure.
wavs/15.wav|We come into a historical age where all meaning or direction has already been made.
wavs/16.wav|All avenues of escape have already been spent.
wavs/17.wav|New attempts merely mutely copying the old.
wavs/18.wav|Facsimiles entirely alien to the spirit of the original.
wavs/19.wav|We attempt to dance just as Lenin did.
wavs/20.wav|Unable to steer away from the unfeeling simulacra of history, one is cursed to not create but reproduce that which has already been made.
wavs/21.wav|All that one can truly envision has already been done.
wavs/22.wav|Philosophy cannot be done with a hammer, as the time for philosophy has passed.
wavs/23.wav|The philosophy of the academy represents its historical age well, practical, non-speculative, social-ethical.
wavs/24.wav|What is there to speculate on today?
wavs/25.wav|What is the purpose of speculation, if the direction of history does not depend upon it?
wavs/26.wav|That is why the philosophy of the current historical epoch can be nothing except practical, pragmatic, realistic, unromantic, mirroring the many newly envisioned procedures for revolutionary change.
wavs/27.wav|The younger generation comes into a world of unimaginable suffering, unquantifiable pain, and an unquantifiable understanding.
wavs/28.wav|They can resort to nothing except the already fixed, failed avenues of escape, gifted to them by history.
wavs/29.wav|Their failures can equate to no meaning, not even that surely incredible, inspiring feeling of historical change felt by those creatives that preceded them by generations, who unknowingly fixed them along such paths.
wavs/30.wav|Lenin danced in the snow, because his change meant something; it was a creation of new avenues, opportunities.
wavs/31.wav|We do not dance.
wavs/32.wav|We cannot dance.
wavs/33.wav|Because the time for creation has passed.
wavs/34.wav|We are the first generation to understand the great weight that has been set upon us by history, while also being unable to imagine the continued existence of such history beyond our own lives.
wavs/35.wav|A history that is yet to be made is no more for there is no future, yet history is all that we can remember.
wavs/36.wav|The simultaneous end of history, and the unimaginably restrictive imposition of it onto our actions paralyzes us, guilts us by association.
wavs/37.wav|It destroys any ability to lift the massive weight of imposed understandings forced onto us by the past, while also removing our actions of any future significance that might drive us to create.
wavs/38.wav|What a cruel world to live in that is the opposite of the Greeks of antiquity, who had no sense of an imposed historical past, beyond the myths they gleefully invented and an open avenue for creating their future.
wavs/39.wav|Surely, if there is a coherent collected history beyond our generations, the crystallized, expressionless, objective representations of us in those accounts will have as much raw meaning to those in the future as these events have to us now.
wavs/40.wav|These fictional future generations must, according to our self-imposed guilt, judge us for our inaction.
wavs/41.wav|Yet hopefully, they will judge us based upon their own epoch’s standards.
wavs/42.wav|One in which the historical significance of their actions does not weigh them down and fix them to premade, predetermined directions of change.
wavs/43.wav|Hopefully, I can only imagine from my own age, they can move in ways we could never move; they can create in ways we never could.
wavs/44.wav|And hopefully, they can forgive us.
wavs/45.wav|One comes into a world steeped in already imposed meanings, directions of action, avenues of change, that appear to one as if they are all that exists, all that could exist.
wavs/46.wav|This is the primary problem facing our current historical epoch.
wavs/47.wav|Our long-term memory weighs upon us as a force; the giant mass of historical facts and inevitabilities, when remembered, generate a gravity that gravely constricts and narrows one’s thoughts and actions.
wavs/48.wav|The historical realities of family, culture, civilization trace their structures onto desire, tying it down, controlling it until there is no room anywhere else for desire to flow except along fixed, predetermined contours.
wavs/49.wav|We must utilize our short-term memory, if we are ever to learn how to create once more.
wavs/50.wav|Creation is not possible if all one has access to, is that which has already been created.
wavs/51.wav|This long-term memory of ours is a dam that must be broken.
wavs/52.wav|And it can only be shattered through forgetting.
wavs/53.wav|Like a flash flood of tremendous force, the burgeoning, billowing onslaughts of desire of the past, altered and ravaged the terrain of world history, smoothing spaces that had been previously striated, sanding down contours that could limit the further uncontrolled movements of desire.
wavs/54.wav|Like the countryside village made unrecognizable by rapidly advancing waves, the face of history had been permanently altered by the many waves of revolutionary desire.
wavs/55.wav|How could we ever forget such as thing as this?
wavs/56.wav|How could desire ever flow outside the boundaries set by this awe-inspiring past?
wavs/57.wav|But these unrelenting flows of desire had not lasted forever.
wavs/58.wav|They had ironically etched themselves into the landscape of history, generating unforgettable contours and striations that now come to define the narrow limits of what seems possible for the creatives of today.
wavs/59.wav|The mnemotechnics of old revolutionary action deny us the very same billowing and burgeoning, which they had attempted to ensure would never again be seen as impossible.
wavs/60.wav|This is why we must forget all over again.
wavs/61.wav|We must work against the lines drawn by the creatives of old, who had no hint of the future limitations caused by their actions.
wavs/62.wav|If we do not learn to forget, we are destined to eternally repeat their failures.
wavs/63.wav|If we do not learn to forget, we are constrained within the hardened and stale realm of pre-constructed meanings that provide no opportunities for change.
wavs/64.wav|Oswald Spengler for instance, was unable to forget the culture that he meant to critique, rendering his cultural criticism useless.
wavs/65.wav|If all meaning in history is truly just family, race, society, civilization, then, as Spengler had seemingly assumed, there is nothing one can do.
wavs/66.wav|He and the other so called revolutionary conservatives can only possibly come to despise the things which they had created and were forced by the same historical necessity that barred them from meaningful creation to begrudgingly follow along.
wavs/67.wav|Their long term memory weighed on them like a force that transcended any possible change of direction away from nihilism.
wavs/68.wav|National Socialism was, if there ever has been, a revolutionary conservative movement.
wavs/69.wav|This assertion ought to come with all the logical conclusions implied by an association with a group of thinkers such as the revolutionary conservatives, who attempted to critique their world while still using their long term memory.
wavs/70.wav|Despite being entirely alien to their ideal worlds and in fact, even worse than the original societies they had critiqued, they all fell in line with this new movement.
wavs/71.wav|Fascism becomes the only possible thing that cultural criticism can produce if it only uses its long term memory.
wavs/72.wav|In attempting to diagnose the nihilism of his age, Spengler became one of its most active proponents.
wavs/73.wav|He claims to have been inspired by Nietzsche, but instead only took heed from the last man.
wavs/74.wav|Any meaningful cultural criticism must come with a forgetting, a spirit of short term, creative exertions and not long term, nihilistic repetitions.
wavs/75.wav|Criticism must come as a rootstalk, growing between the cracks of one’s predetermined, cultural, historical understandings.
wavs/76.wav|It must be weeds that grow between the seams of long term meaning, which attempts to enforce itself as the only thing that can determine one’s direction of growth; it wishes to take up all possible spaces of action and make one think that they have no choice but to accept the nihilism it brings.
wavs/77.wav|As Deleuze and Guattari understood, grass is the only way out.
wavs/78.wav|This historical meaning wishes to be totalizing, wishes to make no room for life, for anything else other than a timid acceptance of itself and its already fixed directions.
wavs/79.wav|These imposed avenues of action come with nothing except a social death stretched out across entire lifetimes.
wavs/80.wav|Life in the present, is the balance between the overbearing inheritances of the past alongside their supposed historical necessities, and the unset directions of the future.
wavs/81.wav|One must never ensure that remembering the former makes one forget the latter!
wavs/82.wav|Life must attempt to grow in all places where the past cannot find it and fix itself to it.
wavs/83.wav|Life must not allow these inheritances to pull it out and replace it with a cold, meaningless facsimile of historical objects that have already become, which are destined to reproduce themselves with an even more catastrophic failure than had been experienced before.
wavs/84.wav|You must not move in the already fixed directions which are set onto you by the past!
wavs/85.wav|You must grow in new ways that spite the very fibre of these inheritances, even if some of them seem admirable, worthy of repetition.
wavs/86.wav|Live in ways that they suggest are not even possible.
wavs/87.wav|Grow alongside avenues of change, that they suggest do not even exist.
wavs/88.wav|Coalesce within spaces between them, which they wish to tell you are already filled by their sterile, cold, meaningless inheritances.
wavs/89.wav|Occupy spaces that these historical necessities cannot even conceive of.
wavs/90.wav|Create in places the police, the ones within your head as well as elsewhere, do not know how to police.
wavs/91.wav|Learn things that the overbearing, professionalized, sanitized knowledges, upheld through the academy and elsewhere, cannot understand.
wavs/92.wav|Create new ideas that the institutions, which uphold these sterilized knowledges cannot, possibly come to know.
wavs/93.wav|Make sure that they cannot even comprehend the extent of how dangerous your new creations are to their petty, insignificant, forced sense of order.
wavs/94.wav|What a crime it would be to reduce all that is, all that could be, to all that has become.
wavs/95.wav|And become, not in the sense that it had existed in its becoming, but merely how it exists to us today.
wavs/96.wav|What could be more paralyzing of an effect than reducing life and its potentialities, directions, desires, to the narrow structures set out for it that have already been tried and failed?
wavs/97.wav|What a miserable life it would be to simply follow that.
wavs/98.wav|That is not even a life, not even a becoming, but merely a lifeless repetition of all that has already become.
wavs/99.wav|We must, as Deleuze said later in his life, distinguish between becoming and history.
wavs/100.wav|Do not follow alongside the failures of the past.
wavs/101.wav|However much the legacy of these failures, wishes to suggest that it is all that you can do.
wavs/102.wav|To frolic as Lenin once did, to create new avenues as he had once done, one must forget him.
wavs/103.wav|Forget what has solidified through history into a sterilized, objective, meaninglessness that cannot hope to inspire the change which one desperately needs.
wavs/104.wav|Shave down these historical facts that have crystallized themselves into your waking consciousness, which make no room for a passionate flame that desires to burn as brightly as it possibly can.
wavs/105.wav|It is only in forgetting, that one can remember what it means to create.
wavs/106.wav|During the early stages of the pandemic, many leftists fell into a moral conundrum concerning lockdown procedures.
wavs/107.wav|When, in general, we would advise one to rebel against the state apparatus and not listen when it screams stay in your home, do not go outside, there was a fairly logical indication that to protect people’s lives, we should encourage the enforcement of public health procedures done by the state and the police.
wavs/108.wav|To even bring up this problem, one must of course, differentiate one’s position from the typical associations that come from the claim that the pandemic is being used to control us, a comment usually inspired by a worldview primarily drawn from the chan message boards and Q drops.
wavs/109.wav|The primary distinction between the leftist concern for the state’s intervention into our daily lives, and the anti-masker’s, is a compassion and love for others.
wavs/110.wav|The belief that the government is authoritarian because one must wear a mask at Applebee’s can only become legible from a contemporary petit-bourgeois account of freedom, which is entirely unconcerned with the well-being of others.
wavs/111.wav|To be truly free for these anti-maskers, is to engage in the American dream, a concept necessarily related to their idea of freedom.
wavs/112.wav|This translates to a desire to be able to spend whatever money one earns on whatever commodities they may dream of on the free market.
wavs/113.wav|Freedom does not concern one’s position at work, the democratization of their society, or the capacity to make meaningful decisions about their life.
wavs/114.wav|Freedom is simply the seemingly endless, yet mind-numbingly similar, opportunities one has to spend their money on the market.
wavs/115.wav|For the state to intervene between the point of one acquiring money and spending it is akin to George Orwell’s 1984.
wavs/116.wav|Thus, the left wing apprehension for following extreme public health protocols comes from a polar opposite cause than the anti-masker’s position.
wavs/117.wav|I use the term anti-masker to provide a distinction between the left and the right critique of state intervention in public health, because the rejection of mask use is a minor inconvenience that may save lives.
wavs/118.wav|Those in the left position would wear a mask even if it was not mandated, out of basic care for those around them, while those on the right will not wear a mask simply because the state tells them they need to.
wavs/119.wav|This is why worries about lockdown measures from the left do not meaningfully spread the virus, while ones on the right do.
wavs/120.wav|The work of 20th-century French critical theorist Michel Foucault, may help us conceive of the leftist apprehension, then later acceptance, of public health procedures in this situation.
wavs/121.wav|Foucault’s position is, ironically, similar to the anti-mask science deniers, just as the anti-capitalist position is.
wavs/122.wav|Yet his analysis is far more symmetrical.
wavs/123.wav|Foucault employs a general critique of the role that public health projects have in the discursive relationships of power that our society is contingent upon.
wavs/124.wav|Foucault recognizes the positive, additive nature of power, in these particular instances, while also showing the negative conclusions of these systems that should be resisted.
wavs/125.wav|The anti-masker’s analysis begins and ends with any public health policies that deny their putrid conception of petit-bourgeois freedom.
wavs/126.wav|When indigenous women are forcefully sterilized by these programs, these anti maskers look away.
wavs/127.wav|When the Reagan administration abandoned the gay community during the AIDS crisis, these anti maskers could not care less.
wavs/128.wav|Yet to what extent has the left meaningfully reconciled with the power the state apparatus has in public health programs?
wavs/129.wav|For Foucault, public health systems are essentially predicated on letting certain populations grow and subsequently leaving other populations to die.
wavs/130.wav|Beginning within history of sexuality volume one, Foucault develops the two interrelated concepts of biopower and biopolitics.
wavs/131.wav|One, biopower, typically describes how the other, biopolitics, is applied within society.
wavs/132.wav|Biopower is, then, a power that relates to the fostering of life for certain populations within society.
wavs/133.wav|This is a modern invention and is a manifestation of power that is additive.
wavs/134.wav|It is additive in the sense that it produces more life and allows for certain sections of a population to grow.
wavs/135.wav|Both ostensibly mean the same thing, that is, they are both translated to English as power).
wavs/136.wav|Yet for Foucault, this type of power also actively constitutes subjects by integrating them into the systems of power through techniques or mechanisms that play out in seemingly mundane and average relations.
wavs/137.wav|These relationships of power allow for discursive meaning making to be possible.
wavs/138.wav|One can think of the disciplinary mechanism of the exam, for instance, as a way of conceiving of Foucault’s general mobilization of the word power.
wavs/139.wav|The examination is seemingly mundane, and not crucial when analyzing the disciplinary society.
wavs/140.wav|The examination does not repress the true nature of the student, but instead actively draws out the production of certain types of knowledge from this student that are satisfactory for the examination process.
wavs/141.wav|Power is additive, in that it produces this knowledge or allows for the student to produce this knowledge themselve.
wavs/142.wav|One may think of the extent to which they have personally learned things in school, as an example of the additive, productive capacities of power.
wavs/143.wav|The student learns and produces the required knowledge of the examination, based upon their relationship with an instructor.
wavs/144.wav|Why does the instructor teach the student to produce particular truths in the examination format?
wavs/145.wav|For instance, in the disciplinary institution of the school, there is a massive game of power being played through these large sets of relationships that allow for the student to produce particular ideas that are tested.
wavs/146.wav|For Foucault, these relationships are predicated on the particular techniques and mechanisms of power that allow for these relationships to reproduce themselves.
wavs/147.wav|These relationships form a chain of subjects held together by power; Each level and the seemingly mundane mechanisms that sustains them is essential for the entire institution.
wavs/148.wav|Only through analyzing these chains, can one meaningfully make sense of disciplinary power, and the massive systems and institutions that this form of power is predicated upon.
wavs/149.wav|Foucault’s method of genealogy is contingent on analyzing these systems and their development based on the general mechanisms and techniques of power employed by some onto others.
wavs/150.wav|These are not abstract powers used by some to dominate others.
wavs/151.wav|These are a discursive set of practices employed by some onto others that form a chain of relationships bound by power.
wavs/152.wav|The seemingly mundane links in these chains are what one must analyze if they are to understand large institutions, such as state power.
wavs/153.wav|Public health programs, for instance, are pure manifestations of biopower.
wavs/154.wav|Biopower, as seen through public health program, provides to certain parts of a population growth of life and protection from death.
wavs/155.wav|It does so importantly, for specific reasons related to the continued reproduction of power.
wavs/156.wav|Biopower is very specific in its implementation.
wavs/157.wav|How can this process be possible, except for the aforementioned chain of power relations that structure it?
wavs/158.wav|Even the acquisition of data and its interpretation, which is required for public health systems, functions on techniques and mechanisms of power.
wavs/159.wav|In its use here, power can be conceived of as having an intention but not a subject.
wavs/160.wav|Subjects may work to reproduce power, without the active understanding they are doing so.
wavs/161.wav|Biopower is intimately related to Foucault’s understanding of governmentality, as put forward in his nineteen seventy-eight lecture security, territory, population.
wavs/162.wav|Governmentality conceptualizes how biopower is implemented, and how it practically relates to individuals within a society.
wavs/163.wav|Within this lecture series, Foucault argues that we ought to broaden our account of ideas such as governance outside of simply political structures and states.
wavs/164.wav|This even includes what Foucault refers to, as the governing of oneself, which is included within the larger societal web of governmentality.
wavs/165.wav|Instead of envisioning the existence of a state, which looms over us and which we must break free of, governmentality emphasizes the general, discursive, intersubjective game of power that allows for the idea of the state to even become legible.
wavs/166.wav|What is missing in the laymen’s account of governance is an ability to account for the ways in which strategies of power embedded within governmentality reproduce themselves without the influence of a police officer, or the implied presence of a court sentence.
wavs/167.wav|Governmentality is also predicated on the work of statistics.
wavs/168.wav|This statistical work can generally be understood on the large-scale scientific management of populations led by the power of experts, who decide who can flourish and who is left to die.
wavs/169.wav|Statistics helpfully monitor the development of population, gain valuable data on how to influence these developments, and develop an episteme that renders biopolitical developments morally essential.
wavs/170.wav|This point is the primary connection between governmentality and biopower.
wavs/171.wav|They are less connected, than they are necessarily conjoined, but regardless, biopower is implemented through a modern system of governmentality, which builds itself upon statistics.
wavs/172.wav|Public health experts may decide that certain populations are at risk.
wavs/173.wav|Let us imagine in this example, it is gay men during the AIDS crisis.
wavs/174.wav|During the AIDS crisis we can see that, in a majority of instances, governmentality did not extend its ability to save gay men.
wavs/175.wav|It instead worked to separate non-queer populations, from the beginning points of infection.
wavs/176.wav|This is the essentially double-edged nature of biopower.
wavs/177.wav|So while biopower may initially seem as though it merely provides support for certain elements of the population, it is also implemented to allow other portions of the population to wither away and die.
wavs/178.wav|Regardless, this decision is still thoroughly for the sake of governmentality.
wavs/179.wav|One can see here how austerity allows for the biopolitical distinction to intensify itself.
wavs/180.wav|One can note an important change from medieval sovereign power, where the sovereign exerts its power by either killing or allowing to live, towards biopower, which either supports a population, allowing it to flourish or letting it die.
wavs/181.wav|Biopower and governmentality are far more intimate and affective towards targeted populations than sovereign power.
wavs/182.wav|The relationships of power that predicated the sovereign society were that of the king essentially ignoring their subject.
wavs/183.wav|Instead of simply allowing these subjects to live, biopower forces them to be integrated more intimately within these mechanisms of power if they wish to not be abandoned.
wavs/184.wav|Through biopower, the state grabs the subject by the hand and says, you will be protected from illness and death so long as you follow me.
wavs/185.wav|Just as the king decides to massacre an unruly peasant village to embolden his status as sovereign, so does the system of governmentality invest in medical infrastructure for certain portions of the population.
wavs/186.wav|Both of these decisions are predicated on a decision related to power, one is clearly far more efficient than the other.
wavs/187.wav|God is dead.
wavs/188.wav|God remains dead.
wavs/189.wav|And we have killed him.
wavs/190.wav|How shall we comfort ourselves, the murderers of all murderers?
wavs/191.wav|What was holiest and mightiest of all that the world has yet owned has bled to death, under our knives.
wavs/192.wav|What festivals of atonement?
wavs/193.wav|What sacred games shall we have to invent?
wavs/194.wav|Is not the greatness of this deed too great?
wavs/195.wav|Must we ourselves not become gods, simply to appear worthy of it?
wavs/196.wav|There has never been a greater deed.
wavs/197.wav|And whoever is born after us, for the sake of this deed, he will belong to a higher history, than all history hitherto.
wavs/198.wav|Much of Nietzsche’s work, when taken at face value, can be incredibly hard to stomach.
wavs/199.wav|Yet we must look far deeper than this surface level understanding, to truly get at the value of his philosophical writing.
wavs/200.wav|Much of his work must be retailored to fit a collective militancy, instead of an individual madness, yet he begins the process that we must complete.
wavs/201.wav|It is specifically in Nietzsche’s transhumanism and his anti-retributivism, all connected to his account of meaning creation and his naturalism, that we can find a way to translate his anti-politic into a political program that can allow for a social world where meaning making is once again possible.
wavs/202.wav|For Nietzsche, humans have no immaterial soul, free will, transparent intellect, or ego.
wavs/203.wav|All of these concepts are a product of a Christian metaphysics that obfuscates our nature.
wavs/204.wav|Nietzsche’s naturalism subsequently folds the human social world into the natural world.
wavs/205.wav|One cannot make a meaningful distinction between them.
wavs/206.wav|To deny the will to power of drives within individuals through for instance, guilt and shame, does the same thing to the human organism that depriving sunlight does to a tree.
wavs/207.wav|Nietzsche is essentially rejecting the division between physical and mental health.
wavs/208.wav|The physical and mental operations are intimately connected.
wavs/209.wav|The collection of sense within the individual is intimately connected to their spirit, both of which exist under their entire self.
wavs/210.wav|One might describe sense as the plurality of different perspectives and beliefs that occupy an individual’s mind, and spirit as the physical drives that move them forward.
wavs/211.wav|A healthy spirit is intimately connected to particular senses allowing themselves to be satiated.
wavs/212.wav|The ego merely attaches itself to the sense that satiates itself the strongest and says, this is me.
wavs/213.wav|We do not have to search particularly far to highlight the contradictory nature of the relationship between the full and authentic self, which the senses exist under, and the constructed and fictional ego.
wavs/214.wav|One may think of a smoker who is trying to quit smoking for instance.
wavs/215.wav|As they take a drag of a cigarette, they might think, I have got to quit smoking.
wavs/216.wav|Yet this is not the full story of what one believes, and the contradictory drive, accompanying the perspective that smoking is bad, attempts to win out.
wavs/217.wav|In many cases, a particular drive may be actively suppressed for the sake of the total health of the self.
wavs/218.wav|The master does not particularly care about the actions of those they deem as bad.
wavs/219.wav|They simply create values to satiate the drives within them.
wavs/220.wav|It is those that the master considers bad, that created the objective moral systems of slave morality.
wavs/221.wav|This system is created in direct opposition to the subjective and life affirming, good, within master morality, and opposes these traits to spite it.
wavs/222.wav|Nietzsche identifies slave morality, as beginning in the early Christians who revolted under the Roman empire, and eventually took it over following Constantine’s conversion.
wavs/223.wav|Under slave morality, the master is considered evil, and the slave is considered good.
wavs/224.wav|Instead of allowing for the creation of values and caring little about those who disagree with them, as every self has different drives that it may attempt to satiate, slave morality imposes an objective moral system that does not allow the affirmation of will to power.
wavs/225.wav|This is the problem that Nietzsche is attempting to solve within his historical situation.
wavs/226.wav|Firstly, Nietzsche is still critical of master morality.
wavs/227.wav|It is precisely the conditions within the system of master morality, that allow for the creation of slave morality.
wavs/228.wav|Within his praise of master morality, Nietzsche is also doing a subtle flattery of the nobility, that may allow for them to act better ensure that individuals are not prevented from satiating their will to power.
wavs/229.wav|For Nietzsche, retributive justice emerges within slave morality.
wavs/230.wav|This new set of morals is entirely based upon vengeance against master morality, and its destruction.
wavs/231.wav|For Nietzsche, all morality comes out of the creditor debtor relationship.
wavs/232.wav|This mnemotechnic of pain is contingent on a natural inclination that humans have towards cruelty or enjoyment of inflicting pain.
wavs/233.wav|This cruelty is proportionate, to be clear.
wavs/234.wav|Mass murderers do not exercise any level of equivalence to their cruelty, and lash out at individuals who do not owe them anything in any way.
wavs/235.wav|It is easier to imagine that we are cruel and enjoy pain, not in the sense that we are secretly all Ted Bundy, but in the same sense that we all indulge in base urges, such as eating unhealthy foods or smoking.
wavs/236.wav|These things, like inflicting pain, may be drives that lead to a decrease in health, yet they are still earthly desire.
wavs/237.wav|But how could this be the case?
wavs/238.wav|Is this not a clear paradox?
wavs/239.wav|Should we not take from this, and his explicit belief that retributivism emerges in slave morality, that Nietzsche is against the enforcement of punishment in moral systems?
wavs/240.wav|Or only allowing a punishment that is life affirming and ensures that the one who is being punished also has the capacity to satiate their will to power.
wavs/241.wav|This is exactly what Nietzsche thought of, when he argued that punishment must be life affirming.
wavs/242.wav|Slave morality takes from those who act against it with increased cruelty.
wavs/243.wav|The slave’s cruelty is worse, because it is calculating and vengeful.
wavs/244.wav|Slave morality uses the concept of utility, to justify its desire towards cruelty through reason.
wavs/245.wav|The technological ingenuity of the blockchain is a development that should not be underestimated.
wavs/246.wav|Using this ingenuity, cryptocurrencies provide an economic system that is untethered from a centralized banking ledger.
wavs/247.wav|The system’s primary genius comes from the large-scale communal recording and verification process of economic transactions.
wavs/248.wav|No trust is required in a central apparatus to verify trade.
wavs/249.wav|It is unlike any monetary system seen before it.
wavs/250.wav|Surely this is what its creators had imagined it would do as well.
wavs/251.wav|Instead, we have come to find out that cryptocurrency is just like the microwave.
wavs/252.wav|In that common-sense view, the State and the Market tower above all else as diametrically opposed principles.
wavs/253.wav|Historical reality reveals however, that they were born together and have always been intertwined.
wavs/254.wav|There is no mystical state of nature in which humans freely trade with each other through barter and crude currency systems as the primary means of resource distribution.
wavs/255.wav|In early hunter-gatherer societies, we can note that, as Graeber demonstrated, resources are allocated and distributed based upon the needs of the collective society.
wavs/256.wav|It is relatively easy to infer from this basic anthropological position, that markets are predicated upon states.
wavs/257.wav|It seems fitting that blockchain technology would be a beneficial resource to make this reality possible.
wavs/258.wav|It is too bad that it isn’t possible.
wavs/259.wav|The primary reason a market is not possible without a state, which is confirmed by the anthropological evidence, relates to the necessary monopoly on violence connected to private property.
wavs/260.wav|This does not lend well to cooperation, if there is no entity that oversees these transactions, and ensures they do not escalate towards violence.
wavs/261.wav|If an individual wants an object, he extols it by saying how fine it is.
wavs/262.wav|If a man values an object and wants much in exchange for it, instead of saying that it is very valuable he says that it is no good, thus showing he desire to keep it.
wavs/263.wav|This argument is carried on in an angry tone of voice until a settlement is reached.
wavs/264.wav|When agreement has been reached, each snatches the object out of the other's hand.
wavs/265.wav|If a man has bartered a necklace, instead of taking it off and handing it over, the other person must take it off with a show of force.
wavs/266.wav|Disputes often lead to fights.
wavs/267.wav|While bitcoin’s decentralized, autonomous ledger system may sneak some power away from the centralized financial systems, blockchain could not hope to predicate an anarcho-capitalist society.
wavs/268.wav|Yet these connections are also, ironically, predicated upon a state to enforce their validity.
wavs/269.wav|Let’s imagine that in a cryptocurrency based anarcho-capitalist utopia, I buy a pair of shoes through bitcoin, and the seller steals them back after our economic transaction is verified.
wavs/270.wav|All that is solid, melts into air.
wavs/271.wav|These capitalist deterritorializations, cannot allow for the possibility of a movement outside of capitalism.
wavs/272.wav|We must be the ones who kill capital.
wavs/273.wav|It must bleed to death under our knives.
wavs/274.wav|While the concept of biopower is obviously related to the current pandemic, and I am not the first philosopher to think about its logical connection during their time inside in quarantine, there are many ways in which the extreme prevalence of public health systems in our intimate lives have both confirmed and denied certain elements of Foucault’s idea of biopower.
wavs/275.wav|Wherever a contemporary society is dealing with the effects of coronavirus, one may find the presence of this biopolitical distinction between those who are saved and allowed to thrive and those who are left to die.
wavs/276.wav|This can also be seen in the disproportionately large number of black Americans who have died of coronavirus as a result of lack of access to medical care.
wavs/277.wav|A recent development that is clearly predicated on this biopolitical distinction is the rollout of vaccines.
wavs/278.wav|Especially as things stand now, with limited doses to provide to the general population, which sections of the population the vaccines are distributed to is entirely contingent upon which populations are deemed valuable.
wavs/279.wav|Therefore, it should be no surprise that as of January 29th, 5.5% of White Americans have received the vaccine, while only 2% of Black Americans have.
wavs/280.wav|This is a direct result of discursive practices and techniques of governmentality, making an active decision that certain sections of the white population of america are more essential to the reproduction of these practices than black populations.
wavs/281.wav|Power, importantly, has an intention and not necessarily a subject.
wavs/282.wav|Meaning that this biopolitical distinction does not necessarily require important people in important positions, related to the vaccine rollout, to make actively racist decisions regarding it.
wavs/283.wav|The rollout may be, for instance, predicated on previously existing medical infrastructure.
wavs/284.wav|The effects of this biopolitical distinction between white and black populations within America have been long-lasting of course.
wavs/285.wav|One may think of the Tuskegee Syphilis Study, where black Americans were purposefully exposed to syphilis and denied treatment to study its effects, as a prime example of biopower and its integration into public health systems.
wavs/286.wav|It is no surprise of course, that there is an increased mistrust in these public health systems within populations that have been mistreated by it.
wavs/287.wav|Therefore, we encounter a complicated situation in which members of these groups have good reason to distrust these systems even if they do have the inherent capacity to allow for some individuals to be protected.
wavs/288.wav|These anti-maskers almost unanimously exist within core populations that are intimately protected by the biopolitical distinction.
wavs/289.wav|Is this skepticism for the very same technologies of power that protect these populations a problem for Foucault’s account of biopolitics?
wavs/290.wav|How can one possibly explain these anti-maskers, through his conception, except to say that biopower is beginning to break down?
wavs/291.wav|We can extend this critique of biopower to the Trump administration’s handling of the crisis as well.
wavs/292.wav|Trump made administrative decisions that ran entirely against the decisions of biopower.
wavs/293.wav|That is, to allow certain populations deemed essential to be protected by the medical apparatus and to leave other populations to die.
wavs/294.wav|How can we reasonably make the claim that governmentality continues to function as Foucault says it has?
wavs/295.wav|The use of biopower to save certain sections of the population is an incredibly intimate relationship of protection.
wavs/296.wav|It is power saying to the subject, I will protect you from death itself and allow you to thrive and reproduce based purely upon my blessings.
wavs/297.wav|There is a certain sense in which we can imagine that biopower, one of many epistemes within Foucault’s account of power, is in a certain contest with other epistemes.
wavs/298.wav|There is a chiasma between, for instance, the episteme of disciplinary power, biopower, and sovereign power within our society.
wavs/299.wav|For instance, racism is predicated upon biopolitical management of populations, requires the sovereign power of police violence and brutality, and simultaneously works through disciplinary power following the implementation of the southern American black codes, which ensured recently freed black slaves would be over-incarcerated.
wavs/300.wav|One episteme constantly has to break down and compete with the other epistemes, for either one to have a presence, yet if one were to absolutely win over the other, then both would be destroyed.
wavs/301.wav|Biopower develops out of the early disciplinary society, not to oppose it necessarily, but to restructure it.
wavs/302.wav|Biopower does not exclude disciplinary technology, but it does dovetail into it, integrate it, modify it to some extent, and above all, use it by sort of infiltrating it, embedding itself into the existing disciplinary techniques.
wavs/303.wav|This new technique does not simply do away with the disciplinary techniques, but it exists at a different level, on a different scale, and because it has a different bearing area, makes use of very different instruments.
wavs/304.wav|I can delve further into the episteme of disciplinary power at a later date, but there is, in a certain sense a competitive symbiotic relationship between these different epistemes.
wavs/305.wav|When a particular episteme gains an excess over others and attempts to fully dominate, then all of these epistemes no longer become possible.
wavs/306.wav|Foucault writes of the nuclear bomb as an example of an excess of sovereign power, the decision between either taking away life or sparing it.
wavs/307.wav|If this sovereign power is exercised too actively, and power decides to kill billions through nuclear hellfire, then biopower and the administration of life no longer becomes possible.
wavs/308.wav|The power to manufacture and use the atom bomb represents the deployment of a sovereign power that kills, but its also the power to kill life itself.
wavs/309.wav|So power that is being exercised in this atomic power is exercised in such a way that it is capable of suppressing life itself.
wavs/310.wav|And, therefore, to suppress itself insofar as it is the power that guarantees life.
wavs/311.wav|The radical use of this sovereign power destroys the capacity to exercise any form of power as a result of excess.
wavs/312.wav|Conversely, Foucault highlights the excess of power in a man-made pandemic that destroys the global population.
wavs/313.wav|This excess comes directly out of the medical, technological apparatus of biopower.
wavs/314.wav|I do not wish to imply that Covid is man-made or has the capacity to destroy the human species and subsequently all form of power relation.
wavs/315.wav|This is one meaningful way of saving Foucault from the most obvious criticism of his account of biopower as it relates to the pandemic.
wavs/316.wav|But regardless of this, it appears as if the current structure of the influence of the economy, is entirely unrecognizable to how Foucault describes 20th-century disciplinary capitalist institutions, such as the factory.
wavs/317.wav|It may be that a new analysis of biopower and its obvious failings in particular contexts, such as the Trump administration, is required.
wavs/318.wav|There is a very strange phenomena, concerning conspiracies theories online, and their political tendencies.
wavs/319.wav|Hey everyone, welcome back to the premium episode for this week.
wavs/320.wav|So this episode is going to relate to the distribution of value.
wavs/321.wav|As a refresher, the total cost of the yarn is thirty dollars.
wavs/322.wav|In a single working day, which produces 20 pounds of yarn on average, there are different ways we can divide up this yarn, in relation to its value.
wavs/323.wav|Now again this may seem sort of absurd or counter-intuitive, because in the physical labor process this is obviously not the case.
wavs/324.wav|You cannot exclude a certain amount of the produced yarn from them.
wavs/325.wav|You cannot calculate the percentage that they are essential in relation to each other.
wavs/326.wav|Let's assume, this cake is being made to be sold, instead of simply consumed.
wavs/327.wav|If this is the case, then we can calculate this relationship.
wavs/328.wav|So because we can divide up the proportions of the value that come from the spinning process, we can do something similar, for the twelve hour labor day.
wavs/329.wav|So this time, we can calculate the labor time of the twenty pounds of yarn.
wavs/330.wav|So because constant capital is not cut out of the equation, the equation is radically different.
wavs/331.wav|You must put constant capital, that doesn't produce any value merely preserves itself, to the side.
wavs/332.wav|Marx criticizes the London economist for making this very same mistake two decades later, after the factory laws.
wavs/333.wav|I hope that was clear.
wavs/334.wav|Thank you for tuning in.
wavs/335.wav|Hey everyone.
wavs/336.wav|Welcome to the third episode of my series on Kapital volume one.
wavs/337.wav|This chapter is of course about money.
wavs/338.wav|I will start with a little short review.
wavs/339.wav|Value, the average amount of time it takes to make something, is the basis for commodity exchange.
wavs/340.wav|Money rules the world.
wavs/341.wav|And that is unlike any other mode of production.
wavs/342.wav|Gold is of course generally chosen as the universal commodity.
wavs/343.wav|Price is an invisible or ideal element of a commodity.
wavs/344.wav|Price still exists empirically.
wavs/345.wav|Your credit score is socially constructed.
wavs/346.wav|Ignoring your credit score is not a good idea.
wavs/347.wav|Importantly, its ideal price is based on its value.
wavs/348.wav|It may be realized.
wavs/349.wav|Money is then a standard of price, insofar as it is an equivalent to other commodities, in physical gold.
wavs/350.wav|The social division of labor is determined by, it moves around value.
wavs/351.wav|There is little demand and there is high supply, and I can't sell my coat.
wavs/352.wav|So, the ability for money to properly circulate is incredible crucial for capitalism.
wavs/353.wav|Gold itself is quite hard to exchange for everything.
wavs/354.wav|States will set the conversion rate between the money commodity, so gold, and other things.
wavs/355.wav|Marx's views on the staten and its role in capitalist commodity production and circulation are relatively few and far in-between.
wavs/356.wav|States will set conversion rates.
wavs/357.wav|How one exchanges paper money for other commodities has nothing to do with paper money's value.
wavs/358.wav|Paper money is very easy to make.
wavs/359.wav|Obviously, the market cannot do that itself.
wavs/360.wav|Paper money is a measurement of value for other commodities.
wavs/361.wav|This is oversimplified, or course.
wavs/362.wav|These workers were generally self-educated.
wavs/363.wav|The factory had not yet really taken place as the primary method of commodity of production within France and Germany.
wavs/364.wav|There is still commodity production and circulation.
wavs/365.wav|It's just that, you don't have a boss.
wavs/366.wav|The hell of capitalism is the firm, not that the firm has a boss.
wavs/367.wav|So this is the end of the cycle of commodity circulation.
wavs/368.wav|If you don't have someone who is finally buying a use value, to consume it, then, what's the point of all of this?
wavs/369.wav|This labor of course, can also be exploited.
wavs/370.wav|This labor does not add value.
wavs/371.wav|You want to get your product to market, while your sure it still has value.
wavs/372.wav|Those arguments do not themselves lead to the end of capitalism.
wavs/373.wav|The wheel continues to spin regardless.
wavs/374.wav|Anyways, moving on.
wavs/375.wav|The chapter example of simple commodity exchange is a labourer who weaves linen to get money, and then sells this linen to buy a bible.
wavs/376.wav|The realization of value in price-form is obviously very stressful, because your commodity might no longer satisfy a social want.
wavs/377.wav|You weave linen, and there's too many people who are weaving linen.
wavs/378.wav|When commodities assume the money shape, they strip off every trace of their natural use-value, and of the particular kind of labor to which they owe their creator.
wavs/379.wav|You want someone else to use it, and you want money.
wavs/380.wav|You look at your linen.
wavs/381.wav|Your labor only becomes public when you go into the market.
wavs/382.wav|I will cut it off here for the non-premium part of the episode.
wavs/383.wav|I will be going over more of the intimate details of commodity circulation.
wavs/384.wav|Thank you to Cory.
wavs/385.wav|The Hyperboreans were a reflection of what some Greeks in antiquity argued life was like in the past.
wavs/386.wav|This myth appears many times in classical Greek sources, with poets, historians, and philosophers testifying to its existence.
wavs/387.wav|Why did this mythology develop in the first place?
wavs/388.wav|Why was it significant enough for multiple sources discovering it to have survived beyond antiquity?
wavs/389.wav|Yet, this myth’s significance carries on beyond the age of antiquity.
wavs/390.wav|Like many other remnants of the ancient world, Hyperborea survived, and was excavated during the Renaissance and even well into modernity.
wavs/391.wav|This mountain range was also perceived to be the origin of the boreal winds.
wavs/392.wav|The ancient Greeks thought cold was primarily caused by this wind.
wavs/393.wav|It was seen as an arctic land blanketed in snow, while also being quite temperate, warm and covered by sunlight.
wavs/394.wav|One explanation for the paradoxical presence of snow and warmth, may have been from exaggerated reports that Northern Europe was often quite sunny during the summer, despite being covered by snow.
wavs/395.wav|These reports must have also left out how cold the region was, or at least this detail was omitted in the Hyperborean mythology.
wavs/396.wav|Hyperborea’s geographical and climatological status was also quite symbolically significant.
wavs/397.wav|Without exposure to this hubris, Hyperborea was a realm where justice and virtue prevailed, represented by its uninterrupted exposure to the sun.
wavs/398.wav|As a sunlit realm of justice protected from the boreal winds of hubris, Hyperborea served as a reflection of a world without the imperfections of humanity.
wavs/399.wav|Notably, the Hyperborea myth generally comes from authors born in ancient Greek colonies, who received educations in mainland Greece.
wavs/400.wav|Greek colonial territories played an essential role in the creation of the Hyperborean myth.
wavs/401.wav|This is a crucial element of the social and political context that the pseudo-ethnographical stories of Hyperborea existed within.
wavs/402.wav|As may be evident, mythology and storytelling were quite crucial for the ancient Greeks.
wavs/403.wav|Even before they had begun to use the written word, they had, as far as we can tell, quite a multiplicitous, varying, and complicated, interrelated set of stories to explain where they had come from, their relationship to foreign cultures and lands, and their relationship to the gods.
wavs/404.wav|Poets would return home to their mother city, and speak of their encounters with wonderous mythological lands and awe-inspiring sea creatures abroad.
wavs/405.wav|The cultural imagination of the Greeks was quite contingent on this phenomenon.
wavs/406.wav|So most of the knowledge the Greeks had of themselves, and that we have of them now, is heavily intertwined within mythology.
wavs/407.wav|This is not to say, of course, that they did not keep track of what they were doing.
wavs/408.wav|They certainly cared quite a great deal for telling and preserving the truth of events unfolding around them.
wavs/409.wav|In ancient Greece, singers and poets were quite an essential aspect of this historical myth-making process.
wavs/410.wav|These poets participated in a process of creation, one that was often seen as literally divine.
wavs/411.wav|Think of the example I read of The Odyssey.
wavs/412.wav|Think of what is being said in these stories.
wavs/413.wav|Who would have had the desire to make these epics?
wavs/414.wav|Who would have needed to approve of these epics, to allow them to continue being told?
wavs/415.wav|On what grounds would they have approved or disapproved of them?
wavs/416.wav|If you are ever reading something like The Odyssey, try to imagine this work’s general societal function, especially as it relates to the likely very common general fear of traversing oceans the Greeks must have had.
wavs/417.wav|Regardless of this, though, the same economic and political factors were often at play behind the motivations to start them.
wavs/418.wav|It must also be kept in mind that many of these colonies were founded primarily for trade.
wavs/419.wav|This Greek contact with radically differing groups, most of which had entirely alien languages and cultures, raises the question of what the Greeks, who emphasized ancestor worship, would make of their new surroundings.
wavs/420.wav|How would they relate these groups to the collection of mythological stories and ideas that allowed them to understand themselves?
wavs/421.wav|The age of exploration during this period, led many wide-eyed explorers to attempt to find the mythical lands described by the classical Greeks.
wavs/422.wav|This is an interesting parallel, of course, given that much of the original mythologies built around these faraway utopias, were also created with a culture experiencing a period of exploratory expansion.
wavs/423.wav|Following the discovery of The New World, many, including Francis Bacon and Alexander Humboldt, argued Plato was actually describing the Americas.
wavs/424.wav|This theory, of course, had to somehow find a way to fit into the dominant material reality of Europeans during the age of colonization.
wavs/425.wav|If these large swaths of land were, in fact, owned by nobody, then there would be nothing wrong with occupying them.
wavs/426.wav|This notion is, of course, absurd and attempts to erase the indigenous peoples who were on these lands and using them to sustain a way of life entirely alien to the European’s intentions for it.
wavs/427.wav|In a certain sense, the notion of terra nullius is quite similar to the original Hyperborea myth.
wavs/428.wav|This is not insofar as they are comparable colonial projects, but instead in the sense that they worked to explain and conceptualize these set of activities while undermining their morally evil aspects.
wavs/429.wav|If the Americas were not authentically being used or claimed by any peoples, then it would be irresponsible for the Europeans not to make use of them.
wavs/430.wav|Using a material analysis of these stories is crucial.
wavs/431.wav|To return to Atlantis, the notion that it was an advanced civilization that rivalled the military strength of even those in the old world, may have potentially interfered with the notion of terra nullius.
wavs/432.wav|He thought he had even identified linguistic connections between the languages of the Mayans and the ancient Greeks.
wavs/433.wav|This trend was necessarily connected to a biblical assertion of the origins of all languages.
wavs/434.wav|In fact, the general assertion that all human languages had a mother tongue was an assumption commonly made well into modernity.
wavs/435.wav|An ancient language, once spoken in the distant past in the area of the Caucasus mountains and spreading by waves of migration throughout Europe and Asia, had itself ceased to be spoken and had left no linguistic monuments behind, but had, as a mother, generated a host of daughter languages.
wavs/436.wav|Upon travelling to Calcutta, he became proficient in Sanskrit, which is, to oversimplify greatly, a classical language that no one speaks natively.
wavs/437.wav|The Sanskrit language, whatever be its antiquity, is of a wonderful structure.
wavs/438.wav|Jones is certainly not the first to notice this similarity between Sanskrit and other languages, but he’s British, so he gets all the credit.
wavs/439.wav|It is also not a surprise that the Christian world had, in its minimal contact with South Asia before modernity, been attempting to find similarities between languages spoken in South Asia and those spoken in Europe.
wavs/440.wav|The supposed common word that Jones found is usually referred to in English as Aryan.
wavs/441.wav|This is the origin of the use of this word, in English.
wavs/442.wav|Jones imagined that these Aryans left the Indo-European homeland and invaded Northern India,
wavs/443.wav|For Jones, the eventual reason this Aryan society crumbled was due to miscegenation between the upper and the lower classes.
wavs/444.wav|It is obviously essential to take note of the political context Jones is developing his theories within.
wavs/445.wav|This was during a period of rapid colonial expansion by the British into the Indian subcontinent.
wavs/446.wav|Instead, they were following in the footsteps of their ancestors, re-affirming their cultural roots, stepping in as the noble caste they once were.
wavs/447.wav|According to them, a noble caste was what brought the region to its cultural, intellectual, and philosophical peak in the first place.
wavs/448.wav|Jones’ hypothesis about the similarities between Sanskrit and his own mother tongue function quite a bit like the hypotheses made about the Celts by Greek colonists.
wavs/449.wav|Jones is technically writing about an authentic phenomenon, that of the Indo-European language group.
wavs/450.wav|Yet, he is twisting this phenomena to fit a specific political need.
wavs/451.wav|To be clear, this does not mean Jones was right about most of what he was saying.
wavs/452.wav|The idea of an Aryan conquest into Northern India, which was followed by a racial caste-based society, is absurd for many reasons.
wavs/453.wav|A Phenotypical marker such as skin colour did not hold the political significance it does now.
wavs/454.wav|Beautiful and interesting video!
wavs/455.wav|All Indo-Europeans owe respect and support to Armenia, where our ancestors came from!
wavs/456.wav|Sorry for letting you down in your war for Artsakh, hopefully you will get it back soon!
wavs/457.wav|The implications of this are absurd.
wavs/458.wav|As the Indo-European culture is so old that even if the Indo-European homeland was in Armenia, the modern Armenian nation could not claim a special attachment to it.
wavs/459.wav|Think of it like the ship of Theseus.
wavs/460.wav|So much has altered and changed since eight thousand years ago, groups of people migrating away and some moving into the region affecting its language, culture, and the DNA of the people, that Armenians would not be especially Indo-European, this is especially true for languages and cultures near the Caucasus.
wavs/461.wav|But that, of course, does not matter for geopolitics.
wavs/462.wav|This is, of course, a full reversal of Jones’ thesis.
wavs/463.wav|It is important to understand the different general motivating factors that drive the out of India hypothesis.
wavs/464.wav|This political ideology was essentially brought into mainstream Indian politics by current far-right nationalist prime minister Narendra Modi.
wavs/465.wav|Many have, quite reasonably, described Hindutva politics as being essentially fascist.
wavs/466.wav|The scholarly literature on the introduction of an Indo-European language into the region of Northern India is far from the racist absurd assertions of Jones and other early colonial British authors on the subject, who used the similarities between English and Sanskrit as a justification for colonization.
wavs/467.wav|In fact, we do not presently know how large this particular influx of linguistically attested outsiders was.
wavs/468.wav|It can have been relatively small, if we apply Ehret’s model which stresses the osmosis effect of cultural transmission.
wavs/469.wav|Many local inhabitants fled eastward, leaving the Indus plains much more open for Indo-European cattle grazing.
wavs/470.wav|This makes sense as a position to hold.
wavs/471.wav|The alien power opposed by the anti‐imperialist voices of the Indigenous Aryan school is intellectual.
wavs/472.wav|The version of historical events arrived at by these means was then imposed on the native population in hegemonic fashion.
wavs/473.wav|Indigenous Aryanism, from this perspective, is an attempt to adopt this same technology to challenge the colonial power.
wavs/474.wav|Bryant does admit that the historical evidence far more than likely suggests, the Indo-European homeland is not in Northern India, only that to conclusively rule it out on this same evidence is not fair.
wavs/475.wav|As I have hopefully highlighted so far, the question of the Indo-European homeland is incredibly political, especially as it concerns Indian politics, and it has been handled in various ways by Indian writers as a result of this.
wavs/476.wav|He argues that the Germanic peoples are the most pure-blooded Aryans.
wavs/477.wav|One may be surprised to see him say this given the fact that he is French.
wavs/478.wav|We can also note two different strands of this Northern European Hypothesis.
wavs/479.wav|The other is a similar utilization of these institutions of knowledge to preserve European racial ideology and political domination over European colonies.
wavs/480.wav|These two phrases are taken directly from Hindu cosmology, in which there is a similarly cyclical understanding of the world.
wavs/481.wav|This is not a surprise, given her general attitude towards the east and its supposed collection of esoteric mystical knowledges that western science cannot attain.
wavs/482.wav|This process is cyclical but, importantly, also evolutionary.
wavs/483.wav|This may appear Darwinian, but, following the period of different cosmological cycles, each root race exists for a few million years before evolving.
wavs/484.wav|According to her, the four previously existing root races only existed on now forgotten continents.
wavs/485.wav|They also reproduced asexually by splitting off like Amoeba.
wavs/486.wav|They only had a single sense in order to communicate, which was hearing.
wavs/487.wav|The second root race was the Hyperboreans.
wavs/488.wav|This group had full physical bodies and reproduced by budding.
wavs/489.wav|They evolved out of the Etheric race and subsequently gained the capacity to hear and touch, as they were now physical beings.
wavs/490.wav|She is essentially attempting to draw out a truth about the origins of the world through these ancient peoples, imagining that modern scientific understandings of the past, which are generally deemed superior to all else, actually remove a certain crucial aspect of the truth.
wavs/491.wav|This is all to say that the term orientalist is not merely a moral condemnation, although in many cases it is.
wavs/492.wav|They were born out of the Hyperborean race through sweat.
wavs/493.wav|As one might have expected from nineteenth century Europeans, there was also a belief by prominent theosophists, who followed Blavatsky’s general analysis, that sub-Saharan Africans and Dravidians were partially descendants of this third, less advanced root race.
wavs/494.wav|It is important to note that Blavatsky’s own account of race was not associated with this later, more crudely Darwinian, account of the evolution of root races.
wavs/495.wav|Blavatsky’s use of the word race was explicitly against the traditional Western understanding of different groups, with identifiable phenotypical markers that signify their cultural and intellectual capacities.
wavs/496.wav|The fourth root race is the Atlantean one.
wavs/497.wav|Many of these Atlanteans were also giants.
wavs/498.wav|Blavatsky’s account of Atlantis, and, more generally, the common modern conception of it that one may find on, say, the history channel, was based upon the works of Ignatius Donnelly in Atlantis.
wavs/499.wav|The final existing root race, which is present during our current cycle, is the Aryans.
wavs/500.wav|The Aryans descended from the far north.
wavs/501.wav|Pre-war Germany continued to stew in the slime of occultist anti-Semitic secret societies.
wavs/502.wav|While most of the archeological findings by Himmler were not particularly useful, and his obsession with iron age Aryans embarrassed some of the conservative members of Nazi high society, this esotericism was not simply nonsense and had a very specific ideological goal.
wavs/503.wav|Himmler attempted to use these archeological findings to justify the holocaust and the mass murder and political suppression of dissidents.
wavs/504.wav|He for instance, used archeological findings of preserved bodies in bogs in Northern Europe dating back to the iron age, as evidence that ancient Aryans participated in the practice of murdering homosexuals.
wavs/505.wav|And used this supposed evidence, which is entirely ludicrous as there is no indication the bog bodies pertain to a practice related to killing homosexuals, as a justification for killing homosexuals in Germany.
wavs/506.wav|They would help facilitate another similar operation in nineteen fourty-two in Crimea.
wavs/507.wav|Some of these esoteric beliefs and findings would even have an effect on Hitler’s view of the world, potentially shaping Nazi foreign policy.
wavs/508.wav|Woe to the European, Germanic, Aryan human beings every time that over there, such a one has emerged, capable of organizing and leading armies and powerful forces made up of this mass of subhumanity.
wavs/509.wav|Interestingly, he viewed the development of these Russian leaders as inevitable, while he did not view the development of a counter-Germanic leader, as equally as likely.
wavs/510.wav|Hitler was seemingly sympathetic to this viewpoint.
wavs/511.wav|It’s important for the future that the Germans don’t mingle with the Poles.
wavs/512.wav|So that the new Germanic blood may not be transmitted to the Polish ruling class.
wavs/513.wav|Himmler is right when he says that the Polish generals who genuinely put up a serious resistance in nineteen thirty-nine were, so to speak, exclusively of German descent.
wavs/514.wav|Himmler’s esotericism also affected his intentions in the east.
wavs/515.wav|Obviously, these plans, while inspired by Himmler’s esotericism, were not impossible without it.
wavs/516.wav|Nevertheless, this is where esotericism eventually found itself.
wavs/517.wav|Many of the ideas produced by the Anhenerbe and other Nazi pseudo-archeological esoterics remain popular for neo-Nazis today.
wavs/518.wav|In fact, oftentimes, Germanic runes are used to subtly signal membership or allegiance to the far right.
wavs/519.wav|I have also done an analysis on my Patreon, access for 2 dollars a month, on how these collections of ideas have made it into modern-day fascist propaganda and memes.
wavs/520.wav|I realized it was far more important to Nazi ideology than I was previously aware.
